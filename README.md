# Roc'n go

So the idea is: you choose a platform, give it app a name and voila. Everything is setup for you to begin coding.

```shell
rng cli foo |> foo.roc
```

## Installation

Since you're interested in this app, I suppose you already have the Roc compiler installed, right? :-)

So as of now, the easiest way might be to just clone this repo and build it locally.

```shell
./build.sh
```
